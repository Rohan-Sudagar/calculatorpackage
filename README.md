# Calculator Nuget Package

Now instead of typing out methods for a calculator, you can just use them. To add, use the Add() method. To subtract, use the CalculationMethods.Subtract() method. To multiply, use the CalculationMethods.Multiply() method. To divide, use the CalculationMethods.Divide() method. Fill in two numbers statically or dynamically and your good to go.
