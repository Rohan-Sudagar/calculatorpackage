# Calculator Nuget Package

Now instead of typing out methods for a calculator, you can just use them. To add, use the Add() method. To subtract, use the Subtract() method. To multiply, use the Multiply method. To divide, use the Divide() method. Fill in two numbers statically or dynamically and your good to go.
